# D26: Describe Data by Statistics

*	Why we need to describe data bu statistics?<br>
	we can clearly view whole data, and quickly know the attributions of the data.<br>
*	From a big data base, we can't do analysis from such that amount of data, so we try to select some samples, means small range data, from population, means mother database.<br>
	Then we try to know the significant of mother database from samples. But right, not complete true.<br>
*	To do analysis with statistics, we need to know some parameters, and use them to lookup following steps; like mean, median, mode (mass value), etc. To check the trend of data, we can use stem-leaf graph to get the median and mode. 
*	There are also different types of analysis parameters:
	*	Degree of discrete: range, variance, percentile
	*	Distribution:
		*	Skewness: right and left skewness. right skwness means that it has right tail in the distribution; left tail respectively.
		*	Kurtosis: use k to represent the kurtosis; when k=0, it has normal distribution; k>0 is taller but thinner normal distribution; lower but thicker respectively.
