# Negative Binomial Distribution(NB)
we have binomial distribution(B) last lecture, and there is negative binomial distribution(NB), meaning that the distribution of fail times when a set of Bernoulli experiments achieve success times.<br>
For example, we want red point of a dice, we might throw once with 1(red), or throw three times with 6(black), 5(black), 4(red). Them the NBD is 1, 3.<br>
The equation is:<br>

# Hypergeometric Distribution(HG)
It represents that how many time we need when we get the success event from a limit set.
