# D27: Describe the world by possibility distribution - discrete distribution

*	We have many possibility situation in our daily life, but how to describe them but some mathmetical expression? There are some discrete distribution:<br>
	(1) Discrete Uniform Distribution<br>
	(2) Bernoulli Distribution<br>
	(3) Binomial Distribution<br>
* * *
# Discrete Uniform Distribution
*	For example, throwing dice. We know that the possibility of each point of a fair dice is 1/6, so here comes some nouce of possibility:<br>
	*	Random Experiment: Each experiment is isolation and orthogonal, and we can't predict the result.
	*	Sample Space (S): All probably results in a random experiment.
	*	Sample: each element in S.
	*	Event (E): A set in S.
	*	Trial: do random experiment once.
* * *
# Bernoulli Distribution
*	In Bernoulli distribution, we only have two result: success and fail, and their possibility. By them, we can have the expect value or some helpful information to analyze the experiment.
* * *
# Binomial Distribution
*	A Bernoulli process consists of Bernoulli experiment, the summation of the n resutls of Bernoulli experiment called Binomial distribution.
