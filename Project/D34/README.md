# D34: Introduce Data Science and the Role of EDA

Which problem is not suitable for data science?<br>
- choose Mr./Mrs. Right
- what will customer buy next time?
- predict defect-free rate

What is data science?<br>
For short, choose the most suitable model, answer the mathmetical problems, and use the results for the potential business value. There are three steps:<br>
Decompose problem -> organize problem -> solve problem<br>
There are three orientations: Field, Analysis, Implementation<br>

* * *
# Data Science - Field:
	We can analyze and solve the problem in different ways, like use my **business knowledge** to analyze the problem, and use my **programming skill** to design the algorithm to solve the problem, and output some **statistical results** for customers.

* * *
# Data Science - Analysis:
	There are four types of analysis: description, diagnosis, prediction, recommandation. Take CHT 499 project for example, we can use above four types of analysis to analyze this example.<br>
	| analysis type | answer | example |
	| :------------ | :----- | :------ |
	| Description | Comfirm the situation (What happened?) | lots of users break off |
	| Diagnosis | reason and result (Why?) | because there is 499 project |
	| Prediction | What may happen? | if we don't follow up, we may lose 40% users |
	| Recommandation | What should I do? | Other sbc communications release some offer |
