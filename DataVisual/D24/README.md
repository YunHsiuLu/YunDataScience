# D24: Basemap - Geography charting

we have to install geos and basemap first:<br>
```
>>> python -m pip install geos pyproj basemap
```

I recommand to do the exercise on Colab and follow the tips on this websites: [how to install and use basemap on Colab](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54613992/how-to-install-and-use-basemap-on-google-colab)<br>
there are many problems on installing basemap on PC, so I will do the example and the exercise on Colab.
